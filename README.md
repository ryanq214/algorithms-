# algorithms-
algorithms that I solve either from code wars or coderbyte.  
I try to do at least 2 a day and add them on. 

Update Feb. 10th 2017-- I will be reducing the additions to the javascript algorithms files, probably to every other day.  These increased challenges are taking more time, and with a full time job it takes too much time away from learning new languages.

Update Dec 31 2016--  I am going to be doing harder algorithms now so I may only upload one algorithm a day depending on the difficulty and how long it takes to solve.

I will also be starting another algorithms file to upload for the harder challenges
